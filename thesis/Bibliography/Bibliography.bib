  abstract      = {Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations. In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics simulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which makes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy logic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We demonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared to prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection without dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality of the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the tractability of such solutions.},

This paper describes the internally implemented algorithms, and how the library uses auto-tuning to dynamically select their optimal combination at run-time. Results are presented, which show that all available algorithms and configuration options have their specific advantages. To demonstrate the library’s capabilities in relevant application settings, it has been integrated into the software package ls1 mardyn. An example of a realistic molecular dynamics simulation from thermodynamics is shown in which AutoPas detects a change in the best possible algorithm configuration. It adapts the simulation algorithm accordingly, sustaining optimal performance without additional user input.},

It acts as a black-box container, internally implementing an extensive set of algorithms, parallelization strategies, and optimizations that are combined dynamically according to the state of the simulation via auto-tuning. This paper gives an overview of the high-level user perspective, as well as the internal view, covering the implemented techniques and features. The library is showcased by incorporating it into the codes LAMMPS and ls1 mardyn, and by investigating various applications. We further outline node-level shared-memory performance and scalability of our auto-tuning software which is comparable to LAMMPS.},

The sampling of intensive variables (temperature T, pressure p) in runs carried out in the microcanonical (NV E)  ensemble (N =  particle number, V =  volume, E =  energy) is discussed, as well as the realization of other ensembles (e.g. the NV T  ensemble). For a typical application example, molten SiO2, the estimation of various transport coefficients (self-diffusion constants, viscosity, thermal conductivity) is discussed. As an example of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, a study of a glass-forming polymer melt under shear is mentioned.},

  abstract  = {The Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential (LJ) is arguably the most widely used pair potential in molecular simulations. In fact{,} it is so popular that the question is rarely asked whether it is fit for purpose. In this paper{,} we argue that{,} whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon{,} it is often used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under those circumstances{,} the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant: most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously{,} there is by now a whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6{,} and that are all different – and that may have very different macroscopic properties. In this paper{,} we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of potentials that are{,} in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction finite ranged{,} vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance{,} and that are designed to be computationally cheap. Below{,} we present this potential and report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties{,} for the most important cases (cut-off distance rc = 2σ (“LJ-like”) and rc = 1.2σ (a typical “colloidal” potential)).},

The first, located in the 1920s and 1930s, is about a computational approach that aimed at pragmatics rather than truth and that remained remarkably robust when quantum theory arrived. The second episode covers the birth of the LJ substance in 1964. Due to increasing interest in computer methods, simulated model substances became objects on their own, the prime targets of investigation. The history of the LJ potential and substance exemplifies the dynamic relationship between prediction, theory, mathematization, and computer instrumentation.},
