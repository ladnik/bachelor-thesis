  abstract      = {Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations. In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics simulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which makes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy logic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We demonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared to prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection without dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality of the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the tractability of such solutions.},

This paper gives an overview of the high-level user perspective, as well as the internal view, covering the implemented techniques and features.

  abstract  = {The Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential (LJ) is arguably the most widely used pair potential in molecular simulations. In fact{,} it is so popular that the question is rarely asked whether it is fit for purpose. In this paper{,} we argue that{,} whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon{,} it is often used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under those circumstances{,} the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant: most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously{,} there is by now a whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6{,} and that are all different – and that may have very different macroscopic properties. In this paper{,} we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of potentials that are{,} in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction finite ranged{,} vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance{,} and that are designed to be computationally cheap. Below{,} we present this potential and report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties{,} for the most important cases (cut-off distance rc = 2σ (“LJ-like”) and rc = 1.2σ (a typical “colloidal” potential)).},

The first, located in the 1920s and 1930s, is about a computational approach that aimed at pragmatics rather than truth and that remained remarkably robust when quantum theory arrived. The second episode covers the birth of the LJ substance in 1964. Due to increasing interest in computer methods, simulated model substances became objects on their own, the prime targets of investigation. The history of the LJ potential and substance exemplifies the dynamic relationship between prediction, theory, mathematization, and computer instrumentation.},

  abstract = {The development of reliable strategies to optimize part production in additive manufacturing technologies hinges, to a large extent, on the quantitative understanding of the mechanical behavior of the powder particles during the application process. Since it is difficult to acquire this understanding based on experiments alone, a particle-based numerical tool for the simulation of powder application is required. In the present work, we develop such a numerical tool and apply it to investigate the characteristics of the powder layer deposited onto the part using a roller as the coating system. In our simulations, the complex geometric shapes of the powder particles are taken explicitly into account. Our results show that increasing the coating speed leads to an increase in the surface roughness of the powder bed, which is known to affect part quality. We also find that, surprisingly, powders with broader size distributions may lead to larger values of surface roughness as the smallest particles are most prone to form large agglomerates thus increasing the packing's porosity. Moreover, we find that the load on the part may vary over an order of magnitude during the coating process owing to the strong inhomogeneity of inter-particle forces in the granular packing. Our numerical tool can be used to assist — and partially replace — experimental investigations of the flowability and packing behavior of different powder systems as a function of material and process parameters.},
