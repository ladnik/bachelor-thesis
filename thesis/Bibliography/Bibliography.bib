  abstract      = {Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations. In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics simulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which makes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy logic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We demonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared to prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection without dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality of the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the tractability of such solutions.},

  abstract  = {The C++ library AutoPas aims at delivering optimal node-level performance for particle simulations. This paper describes the internally implemented algorithms, and how the library uses auto-tuning to dynamically select their optimal combination at run-time. Results are presented, which show that all available algorithms and configuration options have their specific advantages. To demonstrate the libraryâ€™s capabilities in relevant application settings, it has been integrated into the software package ls1 mardyn. An example of a realistic molecular dynamics simulation from thermodynamics is shown in which AutoPas detects a change in the best possible algorithm configuration. It adapts the simulation algorithm accordingly, sustaining optimal performance without additional user input.},

  abstract = {AutoPas is an open-source C++ library delivering optimal node-level performance by providing the ideal algorithmic configuration for an arbitrary scenario in a given short-range particle simulation. It acts as a black-box container, internally implementing an extensive set of algorithms, parallelization strategies, and optimizations that are combined dynamically according to the state of the simulation via auto-tuning. This paper gives an overview of the high-level user perspective, as well as the internal view, covering the implemented techniques and features. The library is showcased by incorporating it into the codes LAMMPS and ls1 mardyn, and by investigating various applications. We further outline node-level shared-memory performance and scalability of our auto-tuning software which is comparable to LAMMPS.},
