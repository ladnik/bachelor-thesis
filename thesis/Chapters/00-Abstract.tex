\chapter*{Abstract}

Particle simulations have become an indispensable tool in research and are used across a wide range of applications. Depending on the specific scenario, different simulation configurations may be more suitable. AutoPas is a particle simulation library that offers a simple black-box interface for researchers. To achieve this, AutoPas reevaluates the optimal configuration at fixed intervals. This thesis proposes a dynamic approach to determine ideal points for the initiation of new tuning phases.
